# SORTING

# Source: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fraudulent-activity-notifications
# HackerLand National Bank has a simple policy for warning clients about possible fraudulent account activity. If the amount spent by a client on a particular day is greater than or equal to 2x the client's median spending for the last d days, they send the client a notification about potential fraud. The bank doesn't send the client any notifications until they have at least d prior days of transaction data.
# Given the value of d and a client's total daily expenditures for a period of n days, find and print the number of times the client will receive a notification over all n days.
# Sample Input: d = 5, [2 3 4 2 3 6 8 4 5]
# Sample Output: 2

# Source: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/candies
# Alice is a kindergarten teacher. She wants to give some candies to the children in her class.  All the children sit in a line (their positions are fixed), and each  of them has a rating score according to his or her performance in the class.  Alice wants to give at least 1 candy to each child. If two children sit next to each other, then the one with the higher rating must get more candies. Alice wants to save money, so she needs to minimize the total number of candies given to the children.
# Sample Input: student ratings = [1, 2, 2]
# Sample Output: 4
# Here 1, 2, 2 is the rating. Note that when two children have equal rating, they are allowed to have different number of candies. Hence optimal distribution will be 1, 2, 1.
